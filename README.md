# Count-coins-using-OpenCV 

An app that attempts to look at a picture recognize all coins and count up their total value.  
It uses openCV for circle recognition.  It would use relative diameters to determine values.

Not even a little robust. HoughCircles is very flaky and requires per image tuning.  Could probably
go much further with this but its just a demo project and not worth the effort.

Now if it could recognize coins from a video feed then I have a demo.

Borrows a lot of code from all over (sorry I did not track the citations)
